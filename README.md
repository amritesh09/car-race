	To run go to "output/car_world".

Click on New Game or press Space bar to start the game(Click may be system dependent for now).

Implementation:

We have used OPENGL Utility Kit to complete the task.

The main program is car_world.c.

The main source of reference is www.nehe.gamedev.net.

We have used bitmap images in the folder "resources" to load images by texture rendering.
